# Class Routine Management System

## Overview

A comprehensive class scheduling and routine management system built with Streamlit for educational institutions. The application enables administrators to manage courses, teachers, and class assignments while automatically generating timetables for different academic programs and semesters. The system supports three academic programs (BCA, BIT, B.Tech AI) with 8 semesters each, operating on a 5-day weekly schedule with 6 daily periods.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application with component-based UI design
- **Layout**: Wide layout configuration with expandable sidebar navigation for optimal screen utilization
- **Component Structure**: Modular UI components separated into dedicated modules (`ui_components.py`) for course management, teacher management, assignment management, and routine display
- **State Management**: Leverages Streamlit's built-in session state and resource caching mechanisms for database connections
- **Navigation**: Tab-based interface within sections for organized user workflows

### Backend Architecture
- **Database Layer**: Custom `DatabaseManager` class providing abstraction over SQLite operations with connection management
- **Data Models**: Dataclass-based models (`models.py`) defining Course, Teacher, and CourseAssignment entities with type safety
- **Business Logic**: Separated utility functions (`utils.py`) handling data validation, formatting, and routine generation logic
- **Architecture Pattern**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns between presentation (UI), business logic (utils), and data access (database) layers

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: SQLite database (`Class_routine.db`) chosen for simplicity and zero-configuration deployment
- **Schema Design**: Three-table relational structure:
  - `Course`: Stores course metadata (code, name, credit hours)
  - `Teacher`: Contains teacher profiles (code, name, designation)
  - `Course_Teacher`: Junction table managing course assignments with scheduling details (program, semester, day, period)
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity between related entities
- **Connection Management**: Cached database manager instance preventing connection overhead

### Core Business Logic
- **Academic Structure**: Fixed 6-period daily schedule (6:30 AM - 11:40 AM) with 50-minute periods
- **Program Management**: Support for three distinct academic programs with semester-based organization
- **Schedule Constraints**: Sunday-Friday academic week (6-day schedule, Saturday off) with period-based time slot allocation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in validation preventing scheduling conflicts for teachers and rooms
- **Routine Generation**: Automated timetable creation with program and semester filtering

### Data Validation and Business Rules
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation for all user inputs with real-time error feedback
- **Academic Constraints**: Enforcement of credit hour limits, teacher availability, and scheduling conflicts
- **Schedule Validation**: 6-day weekly schedule (Sunday to Friday, Saturday off) with teacher conflict prevention
- **Data Consistency**: Server-side validation ensuring database integrity and business rule compliance

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Primary web application framework providing the entire user interface and component system
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for handling routine data structures, DataFrame operations, and display formatting
- **SQLite3**: Built-in Python database interface for local data persistence (no external database server required)

### Python Standard Library
- **Dataclasses**: For type-safe model definitions and structured data handling
- **Typing**: Type hints and annotations for better code maintainability and IDE support
- **OS**: File system operations for database file management

### Development and Testing
- **Simple Test Module**: Basic functionality verification system for deployment validation
